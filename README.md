This project provides an in-depth analysis of YouTube channel performance using Python and machine learning. With a dataset containing key metrics—such as subscriber_count, total_views, video_count, and avg_views_per_video—this repository enables users to gain insights into engagement trends, compare channels, and even predict future performance.

## Features
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the relationships between subscriber_count, total_views, video_count, and avg_views_per_video.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Identify and handle duplicates, null values, and outliers.
3. **Descriptive and Comparative Analysis:** Examine trends, top performers, and engagement metrics.
4. **Machine Learning Model:** Implement a regression model to predict avg_views_per_video based on subscriber_count, total_views, and video_count.
5. **Data Export:** Option to load processed data into an SQL database and save to CSV for easy access.
